# Covid-19
Data Analyst Project

Project Overview: This project aims to analyze COVID-19 data to understand the trends in new cases, total cases, and deaths across various regions and time periods. Utilizing a combination of Excel for data cleaning, SQL for querying and data extraction, and Python for data analysis and visualization, the project provides insights into the pandemic's impact.

Data Sources: The analysis uses publicly available datasets from health organizations, which include daily updates on confirmed cases, recoveries, and fatalities.

Methodology:

Data Cleaning and Preparation (Excel):
Imported raw datasets into Excel for initial cleaning.
Handled missing values and standardized date formats.
Created pivot tables to summarize total cases and deaths by region and date.

Data Extraction (SQL):
Utilized SQL to query and extract specific datasets from a relational database, focusing on relevant metrics such as daily new cases, cumulative totals, and death rates.
Developed SQL scripts to automate data extraction for ongoing analysis.

Data Analysis and Visualization (Python):
Employed Python libraries (e.g., Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) to perform in-depth analysis and generate visualizations.
Analyzed trends over time, comparing regions and identifying peak periods of cases and fatalities.
Created visualizations to illustrate the correlation between interventions (e.g., lockdowns, vaccination rollouts) and changes in case numbers.

Conclusion: This analysis provides valuable insights into the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic, supporting public health decisions and informing future response strategies.
